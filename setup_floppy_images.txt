Summary of useful commands to create disk image files:-
dd if=/dev/zero of=RawGrubFloppy.img count=2880 bs=512
dd if=/dev/zero of=30MHD.img bs=512 count=62730
dd if=/dev/zero of=30MUSB.img bs=512 count=62730

Following is a step by step approach for creating a Bootable Grub Floppy Image file
and Install the OS on it and Boot from Bochs Emulator

1) Create Raw Grub Boot FloppyImage File

	NOTE:- use stage1 and stage2 files that are in /usr/lib/grub
	
	dd if=/dev/zero of=RawGrubFloppy.img count=2880 bs=512
	
	dd if=stage1 of=RawGrubFloppy.img bs=512 count=1
	dd if=stage2 of=RawGrubFloppy.img bs=512 seek=1

2) Create Grub Bootable FloppyImage File

	(a) Create a Floppy Image File
	
		dd if=/dev/zero of=GrubFloppy.img count=2880 bs=512

	(b) Use mke2fs to Format the Floppy Image file in ext2 FileSystem which
		Grub is capable of recognizing.
		
		mke2fs GrubFloppy.img

		NOTE:- A warning prompt may be given saying that the Parameter is not a Block Special Device. 
			   Just say 'y' to continue
		   
	(c) Create a Directory Where you can mount the GrubFloppy.img file

		mkdir MntFloppy

	(d) Mount the Floppy Image File on to MntFloppy Directory

		mount GrubFloppy.img MntFloppy -o loop
		
	(e) Create Suitable Directories and files in the Mounted Floppy which is required
		by Grub for Installing itself on the Floppy

		cd MntFloppy
		mkdir -p boot/grub
		cp /usr/lib/grub/stage1 boot/grub
		cp /usr/lib/grub/stage2 boot/grub
		
	(d) UnMount the Grub Floppy Image file

		umount MntFloppy
		
3) Preparing Bochs Configuration File

	(a) Set RawGrubFloppy.img as the Floppy Drive 0 (floppya) in the bochs configuration file (.bochsrc)

		NOTE:- It is assumed that floppy is set as the First Boot Device in the bochs configuration file.

	(b) Set GrubFloppy.img as the Floppy Drive 1 (floppyb) in the bochs configuration file (.bochsrc)

4) Installing Grub on GrubFloppyImage File

	(a) Start Bochs Emulator

	(b) The grub prompt will appear where u run the following commands without error

		grub> root (fd1) 
			# Now the Grub should Identify the ext2 fs
		grub> find /boot/grub/stage1 
			# Should find the file... this is just to verify that everything is fine
		grub> setup (fd1) 
			# This should successfully install grub on to the MBR of GrubFloppyImage File

	(c) Stop the Emulator

5) Installing the OS 

	(a) Mount Grub Floppy Image file

		mount GrubFloppy.img MntFloppy -o loop

	(b) Copy the OS image file into MntFloppy/boot Directory

		cp <OS.exe> MntFloppy/boot

	(c) UnMount the Grub Floppy Image file

		umount MntFloppy

6) Booting OS using Grub

	(a) Set the GrubFloppy image file as the Floppy Drive 0 (floppya) in bochs configuration file (.bochsrc)

	(b) Start Bochs Emulator

	(c) In the Grub Prompt run the following command without error to boot the OS

		grub> root (fd0)
		grub> kernel (fd0)/boot/<OS.exe>
			# Should Identify <OS.exe> format (as a MultiBoot Complient)

		grub> boot
			# Should Start the OS
